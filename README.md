# Spam-Mail-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning.


Overview:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). Utilizing a dataset comprising email content and corresponding labels, the analysis seeks to achieve accurate predictions.

Key Features:
Dependencies Installation: A list of required Python libraries and modules.
Data Collection & Pre-Processing: Loading of the dataset followed by an initial examination.
Feature Engineering: Expected use of techniques like TfidfVectorizer to convert email text into numerical data.
Model Building: Deployment of machine learning algorithms, with an indication of using LogisticRegression.
Model Evaluation: Measurement of model performance using metrics like accuracy.
Dataset:
The dataset comprises email content under the "Message" column and corresponding labels (either 'spam' or 'ham') under the "Category" column.

Tools & Libraries:
Data Manipulation: Pandas, Numpy
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, TfidfVectorizer, train_test_split, etc.)
Usage:
Install the necessary dependencies.
Load the dataset "mail_data.csv".
Execute the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
